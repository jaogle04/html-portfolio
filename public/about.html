<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a sophomore in college currently studying Civil Engineering. This might
  seem odd considering I have been currently learning html and other web
  development skills. My reason for this is I really enjoy solving problems and
  working through projects but I just do not enjoy what I am stuyding right now.
  However, in one of my college classes we learned MATLAB. While I did not
  particularly enjoy MATLAB a lot, I did love the process of learning how to
  code a project.This led to a new excitement of wanting to learn more types of
  languages.

  I ran into a huge issue however, I had no idea where to start. That was until
  a friend showed me a Udemy course for web development. Now I am here and I am
  so glad I took the plunge into learning how to do this. I have not felt an
  excitement to learn like this in a long time, and never thought I would enjoy
  teaching myself something on my own. I can not wait to learn ever more types
  of languages, even they do not exactly deal with web development.
